## Introduction
Welcome to the introduction of Docusaurus, as part of my E-portfolio for the Software Engineering 2022 course at DHBW Karlsruhe. Writing clear and concise documentation quickly and reliably is essential for modern corporate culture. Focusing on writing the text rather than wasting time on technical challenges can significantly impact efficiency. This is where Docusaurus enters the game!

## What is Docusaurus
Docusaurus is an open source project for building and maintaining websites with familiar tools like [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).

## Virtues
Docusaurus is a static-site generator. It builds a single-page application with fast client-side navigation, leveraging the full power of React to make a site interactive. It provides out-of-the-box documentation features but can be used to create any kind of site (personal website, product, blog, marketing landing pages, etc.).

- Built with React: Extend and customize with React
- Pluggable: Bootstrap your site with a basic template, then use advanced features and plugins
- SEO friendly: HTML files are statically generated for every possible path.
- Powered by MDX: Write interactive components via JSX and React embedded in markdown and share code in live editors
- Search: The site is fully searchable.
- Document Versioning: Helps to keep documentation in sync with project releases.
- Internationalization (i18n): Translate a site in multiple locales.

## Quickstart

If you prefer to run a demo quickly, Docusaurus offers the possibility to set up a demonstration page that provides a short tutorial.

First install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and create a new Docusaurus site with following command:

```bash 
npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic 
```
After the installation enter the folder and start the site:

```bash 
cd my-website
npx docusaurus start
```
Open <a href = http://localhost:3000> http://localhost:3000 </a> and have fun with the tutorial!

Alternatively, the code can be tried out [directly](https://stackblitz.com/github/facebook/docusaurus/tree/starter), or the tutorial can be viewed [online](https://tutorial.docusaurus.io/).
